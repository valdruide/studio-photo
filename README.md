# Photo Gallery SaaS

A SaaS platform designed for photographers who want to showcase their photo projects and collections in an elegant, fast, and fully controlled environment.

This project was born from a very concrete need: displaying extremely large, high‑quality studio images without compromising performance, while providing a simple, efficient admin dashboard suitable for everyday use.


## 🎯 Project Goals
- Provide photographers with a turnkey tool to build and manage a professional gallery / portfolio
- Easily manage categories, collections, and photos from an admin interface
- Ensure excellent loading performance, even with very large images
- Allow self‑hosted infrastructure (no dependency on third‑party image SaaS like Cloudinary)
- Build strong foundations for a commercial, scalable SaaS product
## ✨ Current Features
### Gallery & Frontend
- Photo galleries organized by categories and collections
- Optimized image loading (formats, sizes, lazy loading)
- Minimalist, fluid navigation focused on visual impact
- Full support for very large, high‑resolution images
- "Zoom-in" on the image in fullscreen mode
### Admin Dashboard
- Secure admin authentication
- Photo upload
- Photo listing and management
- Organization via categories and collections
- Visibility control on categories, collections and photos
- Manual ordering of categories, collections and photos
- Categories styling options
### Image Management
- Upload images without manual pre‑resizing
- Automatic server‑side generation of required formats
- Preservation of original image files
- Architecture designed for large image libraries

## ⚙️ Scripts & Automation
### `/scripts/import-pocketbase.mjs` - with Nodejs

**Bulk Photo Import Script**

The project includes a bulk import script designed to populate the database with categories, collections, and photos in a single pass.

This script is intended for:
- Initial project setup
- Large photo libraries
- Fast migrations or re-imports

**It handles:**
- Categories → collections → photos hierarchy
- File uploads
- Ordering
- Visibility flags
- Optional HTML descriptions
- Duplicate prevention

**▶️ Run the import script** `node scripts/import-pocketbase.mjs`

> ⚠️ **The script expects a JSON file** named `import-data.json` describing the full content tree and local paths to image files.

### `import-data.json` structure (Template)
```json
{
    "categories": [
        {
            "slug": "category-slug",
            "title": "Category title",
            "order": 1,
            "isHidden": false,
            "collections": [
                {
                    "slug": "collection-slug",
                    "title": "[ Collection Title ]",
                    "descriptionHtml": "<p>Optional HTML description</p>",
                    "order": 1,
                    "isHidden": false,
                    "photos": [
                        {
                            "file": "public/series/Collection/image-1.png",
                            "name": "Photo title",
                            "descriptionHtml": "<p>Optional HTML description</p>",
                            "order": 1,
                            "isHidden": false
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Notes**
- `file` must point to a local image path
- `descriptionHtml` fields are optional
- Ordering is explicit and respected during import
- All visibility is controlled via `isHidden`

This script is designed as a reusable building block, with potential evolution toward a more advanced admin dashboard.
